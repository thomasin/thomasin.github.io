      <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
      <p>
          This is something I've always struggled with, I have very high standards while simultaneously struggling to achieve them. This can turn my coding into a long, exhuasting process. I do believe that the things I'm forced to learn while trying to make everything as perfect and simple as I can are very useful. However, this time around I wanted to focus on learning and in particular media queries which I've never used before. To do this, instead of designing a bloated website that would take a lot of my time for me to be satisfied with I designed one that was highly simple, I loved almost straight away, and left a lot of time for me to perfect media queries and understand how they worked.
      </p>
      <h5>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5>
      <p>
        I've always thought of meditation as partner-in-crime to working out, one trains your body (mostly) and the other trains your mind. I thought of it as a beautiful practice, and I knew if I put effort and time into it the rewards I would get in terms of stress relief and better moods would be incredible but I could never get the motivation.
      </p>
      <h5>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
      <p>
        That even the tiniest amount a day will make a difference. I loved the part about scientific inquiry being important, and meditation being so supported by studies and relevant to everyone no matter who they are!
      </p>
      <h5>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
      <p>
        Creating an intention for your meditation and mindfullness. I like the thought that thinking an intention every day can influence yourself to achieving it. I also really want to practice experiencing, not judging or reacting. That is something I struggle with and it's really important to me.
      </p>
      <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
      <p>
        I want to have calm, clarity and peace of mind every single day! That sounds like it would be wonderful.
