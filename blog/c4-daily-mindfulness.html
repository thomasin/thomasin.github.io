      <h5>What did you learn from your mindfulness conversation? How did the other person find it?</h5>
      <p>
        I loved it, it felt strange and uncomfortable but we hadn't seen each other in a couple months and I feel like this enabled us to touch on topics that we would have forgotten and not gotten around to otherwise. I was pleasantly surprised at how well I remembered everything he said and how much I retained. He found it quite effective because usually people have the tendency of interuppting or veering off topic. We were both happy at the end of it.

      <h5>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5>
      <p>
        I think one that is going to be really good for me is the active mindfulness. I go to the gym and when I'm training there is nothing more important than being mindful and connected to what's going on in my body. Making that extra effort to be aware of myself could really help!
      </p>
      <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
      <p>
        It took me until 10:30pm Sunday night to get around to having a mindful conversation with someone. I've been really withdrawn lately and I was so nervous about it but I'm happy I forced it to happen because it began a really nice conversation that made my night a lot better (:
