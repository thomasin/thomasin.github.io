   <h4>What are your impressions?</h4>
    I am impressed (-: It's great to see teachers, everyone even community so invested in students and willing to help them succeed. It's
    a nice change from my experiences so far. To have a small class where everyone is there for the same reasons and wanting to learn as much
    as they can is really personally motivating, because I know every single person around me is giving it their all.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this kind of culture?</h4>
    I don't feel like I'm the most active participant, which is something I want to change, I would rather give someone else the chance to say
    something than be in the spotlight myself. I work best in teams of two rather than groups which is where I believe I'll find myself engaging
    the most and really becoming enthusiastic about sharing what I'm learning and working on. A goal for me in Phase 0 is becoming better at
    contributing and offering an opinion in group discussions. However, I love learning and in any environment where people are obviously passionate
    I'll actively engage in.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed?</h4>
    Not significantly, I did a lot of research before applying and this is living up to my expections and more, but not very different to what
    I came in expecting.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h4>
    I am so excited. Nervous yes, I'm really going to have to step out of my comfort zone but that can only be a good thing. I am really looking
    forward to learning the soft skills that I've struggled with in the past and I know will be necessary for my future.
