<b>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</b> <br>
It seems like a unique way of keeping every student engaged and motivated to learn. It appeals to me because I think working in a team
is incredibly driving, it's so easy to fall behind and to stop making an effort when you think nobody will notice or care. It seems like
there is a strong focus on learning over knowledge. I do think that there is a small minority this wouldn't work for, but overall the culture
would be so much more motivating for most than traditional schools, who focus on knowledge over learning. <br>
<b>What are your impressions?</b> <br>
I am impressed (-: It's great to see teachers, everyone even community so invested in students and willing to help them succeed. It's
a nice change from my experiences so far. To have a small class where everyone is there for the same reasons and wanting to learn as much 
as they can is really personally motivating, because I know every single person around me is giving it their all. <br>
<b>How do you see yourself engaging with this kind of culture?</b> <br>
I don't feel like I'm the most active participant, which is something I want to change, I would rather give someone else the chance to say
something than be in the spotlight myself. I work best in teams of two rather than groups which is where I believe I'll find myself engaging
the most and really becoming enthusiastic about sharing what I'm learning and working on. A goal for me in Phase 0 is becoming better at 
contributing and offering an opinion in group discussions. However, I love learning and in any environment where people are obviously passionate
I'll actively engage in. <br>
<b>Have your expectations of EDA changed?</b> <br>
Not significantly, I did a lot of research before applying and this is living up to my expections and more, but not very different to what 
I came in expecting. <br>
<b>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</b> <br>
I am so excited. Nervous yes, I'm really going to have to step out of my comfort zone but that can only be a good thing. I am really looking
forward to learning the soft skills that I've struggled with in the past and I know will be necessary for my future.
