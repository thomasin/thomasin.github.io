<h5>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h5>
<p>It's like you're writing an article to be put into a magazine. HTML is the final draft of the article, you submit that and it goes to a designer (CSS) to be made beautiful with nice fonts and photos. The final step to publication is being given to the editor which acts like the DOM, it refines tweaks and structures your article so it's ready to be read.</p>
<h5>What is meant by boxifying design?</h5>
<p>Boxifying design is a way of thinking about website design where you focus on every element of a design being held in a box, it's a good way of thinking about the elements on a page as they are always square. It enables you to get down to the true structure of a design rather than being mislead by the styling.</p>
<h5>What is the box model?</h5>
<p>The box model is how you present block elements on a page. Like a cardboard box you have the content which is surrounded by padding (bubble wrap), the border of the element (the box itself) and the margin, which is the distance the box keeps from everything around it.</p>
