<b>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</b> <br>
I tried the pomodoro technique, and the tips I picked up from the <a href="http://paidtoexist.com/counterintuitive-productivity/">Seven Counterintuitive Ways to be Insanely Productive</a> article. <br> 
<b>What did you find interesting?</b> <br>
I found those seven tips really interesting and not like what I've heard before, which is generally more of the same techniques and ideas you always find when yyou google "How to be productive". It was positive, motivational and made me actually think about the driving forces behind productivity. <br>
<b>What worked for you?</b> <br>
Starting small, with a goal of two minutes of study and focussing on feelings and meaning behind actions was helpful. They made me feel less down on myself when I was taking a break from study, more able to call it quits when I was clearly too tired or distracted to work without feeling guilty. Personally, I think overall well being, mental state is the biggest factor behind productivity and if you take care of the fundamentals, physical and mental health, everything will fall a lot easier into place. This helped me even when I wasnt working, which made studying a lot less stressful. Pomodoro technique was interesting, and I could see how it could work, but not for me, for someone with a different mindset.<br>
<b>What will you experiment further with?</b> <br>
Trying to make all my actions meaningful, focussing on how I'm feeling over what I've accomplished and starting with small goals!
