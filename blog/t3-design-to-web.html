      <h5>Responsive sites:</h5>
        <p>
          A responsive site is a design that adapts to fit the device and screen size it's being viewed on. It is important for readability and maintaining site functionality no matter what people are using.
        </p>
      <h5>Mobile first design:</h5>
        <p>
          Mobile first design is the practice of designing a website to be viewed on a mobile phone before then designing the parts that change as the screen size gets bigger. This is important because then phones don't have to read through as much code as the desktops. As they have less processing power this saves time and makes websites load faster.
        </p>
      <h5>Frameworks:</h5>
      <p>
        Frameworks are prewritten code that you can use when building a website so you don't have to start from scratch - they give you a solid base when creating layout and they also provide inital styling. They are helpful because they create consistency over a project as well as saving time on coding, but they can create unnecessary code that you don't end up using and it can be harder to diagnose problems.
      </p>
      <h5>Wireframes:</h5>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like a rough draft, sketching out the content of a website and how it is supposed to function - without any colours, typefaces or final content. It's important to make sure a design is easily understandable before any styling is added.
      </p>

          <div class="six columns"><img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" /></div>
        </div>
      <p>
        The part of the wireframes I found the hardest to implement was the transition between the mobile and the desktop designs. I had some problems with the media queries.
