  <h4>What did you take from this chapter?</h4>
  <p>
    This book is so interesting to me, it's putting into words something I've been attempting to achieve and bring to my life for such a long time. I have a really instinctive reaction to things and working to slow that reaction down so I'm responding rather than reacting is something I've always tried to do with varying degrees of success. I think it impacts everything, from your own happiness to your relationships with other people. I love the idea that your brain is trainable. Throughout my life I've used that flexibility often and I really do believe that what this chapter is saying would not only be highly beneficial but also achievable with patience.

  <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfullness?</h4>
  <p>
    I've had a lot of stress in my life recently and as a result I feel like my mind is a lot slower, heavier and uninspired at the moment. Two minutes wasn't long enough to get that heaviness out of my head I think I'd need to use longer times or while walking or working out as those are the times I feel lightest.
