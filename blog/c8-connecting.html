      <h5>Have you tried using any of the insight or techniques for growing trust and sincerity?</h5>
      <p>
        I don't think I make any particular effort to trust people. I often give people the benefit of the doubt and I have a belief that 95% of people genuinely want everyone else to be happy. I always naturally trust and believe people but I think it's easy for that to be corroded, especially in team situations because I can be a bit too much of a perfectionist. I would like to start making a special effort to build that up so I can rely on people in work and school enviornments without having to think twice.

      <h5>Try empathic listening</h5>
      <p>
        I had a very good opportunity for empathic listening this week where someone was upset at me for something and I didn't think they had any reason to be. Unfortunately I didn't take this opportunity and I went on the defensive. In hindsight I think that if I had taken the time to make them feel listened to and understood the situation could have been much more peaceful than it became. <br>
        I tried to use empathic listening again when listening and giving advice to a friend yesterday. It was relatively easy because I have been through similar things. Hopefully it worked in making them feel understood and listened to. A challenge for me then is using it in a conflict or a negative situation rather than one where I want to listen.

      <h5>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>
      <p>
        It was really peaceful and I definitely felt happiness. Can definitely see how making that mental wish for everyone to be happy can affect your relationships and general outlook for the better.
