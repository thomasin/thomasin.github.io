      <h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
      <p>
        For me specifically it looks pretty good. I guess I was super lucky in that I figured out what I was passionate about and what made me happy early on. I have managed to focus my attention on those things I know bring me joy or bring about 'flow', so my life is very directed and I am confident about my happiness even when having some down days. I'm not as sure about the higher purpose lens, I'm not very altruistic and I'm often selfish and I think that happiness is going to be something I have to really work on to achieve.
      </p>
      <h5>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise</h5>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>What are your core values?</strong> I'm a big believer in the value of happiness. I see it as an assessor of whether something is worthwile doing. If it doesn't bring me happiness than I won't do it but I also understand that sometimes you don't see happiness right away and sometimes you have to work for it. I really value physical and mental health and I value passion and respect both towards others and self.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What do you stand for?</strong> I stand for the right of everyone to be able to go through life without judgement and for people to understand that differences aren't necessarily negative. It's pretty general and covers a lot of issues, but I stand for uniqueness and acceptance.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h5>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>
      <p>
        I believe I am a very strong minded person. I have great trust in the ability of myself to get back on track. I have done it multiple times in my life when I have had a couple months of depression here and there and I know the ingredients that go into improving my mood and happiness, and with a bit of perserverance I know I can always get back on track. This is a "everything will work out in the end" mindset. Because of that, and a good dose of luck, I have become a very resilient person so this chapter really resonated with my own experiences.<br>
         It is a struggle for me to experience failures or successes as a strong emotion, I'm really personally apathetic about it because I always understand the factors that went into them so move on easily. The strongest emotions related to them I feel are when my failures affect my family and this really bothers me so I meditated on my guilt over this, it felt nice to focus on letting go of those negative feelings. Conversely, I feel majority of my successes in my family and friends' pride for me. I thought it was interesting how my feelings about my failures and successes are dictated by how they affect other people.
