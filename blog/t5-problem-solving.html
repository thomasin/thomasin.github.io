      <h5>A time I got blocked on a simple problem</h5>
      <p>
        The problem was the chessboard question, creating a chessboard with empty spaces for the white squares and #s for the black squares. I figured out that I needed different loops for rows and columns but I had no idea how to make the program know whether to write in a space or a #. I tried writing it out in pseudocode but because I fundamentally didn't understand the logic I'd have to use this didn't help. Again with rubber ducking and trying something, I wasn't struggling with how to write the code but the actual reasoning behind a solution. <br>
        This kind of stressed me out so I took a bit of time off and did the last question instead. When I came back to the problem I worked at it backwards - I wrote down the output that I wanted in a simple text file and studied that to look for any commonalities I could use. That enabled me to solve the question, and gave me a new problem solving technique to use in future (-:
      </p>
      <h5>A time I solved a problem in an elegant way</h5>
      <p>
        The problem was making a line of #s with each new line having one more #. I finished my solution, which worked perfectly, but I felt like it was a bit complicated for such a simple seeming code. Once I'd finished all the exercises I went back over everything I'd done and looked at it again. I tried using pseudo code, googling. Finally I felt pretty confident that I'd done it as concisely as I could possibly have done. I checked the solution and it had two lines less than I'd put in. They had changed the code of something I've been so used to using and typing the exact same way every time, I'd forgotten it could even be changed. My mind had just kind of ignored it when I was thinking about the problem.<br>
        I didn't actually solve this myself, the final solution code was given to me but it really opened my eyes to always looking and thinking about every possibility. I feel like I learned a lot from that experience, and the resulting solution was definitely elegant.

      <h5>Problem solving techniques and processes</h5>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong>: I think from all my maths study and growing up playing around with programming that thinking in logic chains comes so naturally to me that pseudocode rarely helps. I do tend to make my code a bit fatter than it could be but I imagine I'll get better with experience. </li>
          <li><strong>Trying something</strong>: This helped me a lot on the Codeacademy courses where often my mind blanked on the exact way to write out certain code and I just basically guessed and played around until I struck on the right way to do it. This kind of problem solving is fun but I don't think it is as good for my learning as researching a problem.</li>
          <li><strong>Rubber ducky</strong>: I haven't used this technique much so far although I'm always talking to myself when I'm writing code if that counts (-: It seems like a good way of finding a solution because you can let your thoughts get rambly and a random tangent might lead to the answer.</li>
          <li><strong>Reading error messages</strong>: This saved my life so many times this week when I'd missed a bracket or something just wasn't working. It was the first thing I always turned to when something didn't work and 9/10 times told me how to fix it. </li>
          <li><strong>Console.logging</strong>: I used this as a last resort when I really just didn't understand why my code wasn't working, there were no error messages and the wrong result was being shown. It was so helpful in seeing which part of the control flow wasn't doing what it was supposed to. I really found this valuable, but tried to keep it till I had no other ideas as it meant really digging in to the function.</li>
          <li><strong>Googling</strong>: Of course, love googling. Any time I see a function or bit of code I don't understand, or any time I think some bulky lines could be made a lot tinier I go on google tangents. A lot of fun but often time consuming way to solve problems.</li>
          <li><strong>Asking your peers or coaches for help</strong>: I haven't really done either of these that much I haven't been stuck enough yet. I've always kept asking other people for help as an "only in emergency" option, because I feel a bit cheated out of the satisfaction I get when I figure something out, which is my favourite part of problem solving! Such a valuable resource though and it's great to know that it's always available.</li>
          <li><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong>: I've been very bad at this so far, I think a lot about the lessons I've learned from previous problems but I don't think I've been very good at using reflection to clear my head, focus my attention and bettering my problem solving. My mind is as chaotic as ever.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h5>Array methods</h5>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>.map()</strong>: The map method is a really great way of changing each item in an array. What it does is it iterates through the array, applying a function to each value and returning the mutated values into a new array.</li>
          <li><strong>.reduce()</strong>: Reduce is a really interesting method. It passes each item of an array through a function, each time assigning the returned value back into the function as the first argument. This can be used in a variety of ways, making reduce super multipurpose and strong.</li>
          <li><strong>.filter()</strong>: Filter is pretty self explanatory I think, it passes each item of the array through a function. If that item evaluates to true it is included in a new array. All items that evaluate to false are skipped over.
